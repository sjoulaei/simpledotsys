## switch panes using Alt-arrow without prefix
#Switching between panes is one of the most frequent tasks when using tmux. 
#Therefore it should be as easy as possible. Iâ€™m not quite fond of triggering the prefix key all the time. 
#I want to be able to simply say M-<direction> to go where I want to go (remember: M is for Meta, which is usually your Alt key). 
#With this modification I can simply press Alt-left to go to the left pane (and other directions respectively):

bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
bind -n M-Down select-pane -D

# Enable mouse control (clickable windows, panes, resizable panes)
set -g mouse-select-window on
set -g mouse-select-pane on
set -g mouse-resize-pane on

# Enable mouse mode (tmux 2.1 and above)
#set -g mouse on
